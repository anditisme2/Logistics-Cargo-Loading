# Logistics-Cargo-Loading

**Overview**

This project implements an optimized cargo-loading system using the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. It helps in determining the most valuable combination of cargo that can be loaded onto a vehicle while adhering to weight constraints.

**Features**
1. Selects Cargo using Dynamic Programming and Greedy Approach for maximizing profit
2. Outputs the scenario with the maximum profit while the input items are within the weight/ quantity constraints 

**Algorithms Used**
1. 0/1 Knapsack Dynamic Programming -Ensures optimal cargo selection
2. Greedy Approximation -Provides a near-optimal solution faster for real-time use cases.

**Dependacies**
1. Python 3.x

**Future Enhancements**
1. Create a web-based user interface
2. Add real-time tracking and visual representation of loading
